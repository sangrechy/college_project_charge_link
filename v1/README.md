# ChargeLink - Smart Charging Controller & Telemetry System

A college engineering project delivering an intelligent charging management and telemetry system combining custom ESP32 hardware and a cross-platform Flutter mobile application.

## 📱 Prebuilt Android APK

You can download and install the latest standalone release build directly:
- **[ChargeLink-v3-release.apk](apks/ChargeLink-v3-release.apk)** (v3.0.0, Release Mode, 46.5 MB)

---

## ⚡ Overview

ChargeLink bridges physical charging hardware with an intuitive mobile dashboard over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):
- **ESP32 Smart Box**: Monitors input/output voltage, current, and wattage in real time via an INA219 sensor, controls charging relay paths, and provides voice alerts.
- **Flutter Mobile App (application_v2)**: Displays real-time live telemetry comparing charger output vs. phone intake, computes cable transmission loss and efficiency, tracks battery % and phone temperature history (Day/Week views), and persists historical telemetry for 30–60 days via SQLite.
- **Hardware-Aware Battery Telemetry**: Includes dual-cell battery compensation (e.g. OnePlus / Oppo dual-cell architecture) and active display/system load compensation for accurate power readings.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install Prebuilt APK
1. Download [ChargeLink-v3-release.apk](apks/ChargeLink-v3-release.apk) to your Android device.
2. Open the file and allow "Install unknown apps" if prompted.
3. Grant Nearby Devices (BLE) permissions when prompted.

### Build Flutter App from Source (application_v2)

1. **Navigate to the application folder**:
   ```bash
   cd application/application_v2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run on a connected Android / iOS device**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### ESP32 Firmware

1. Open `firmware/SmartChargeBox/SmartChargeBox.ino` in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
2. Select your ESP32 board and configure serial baud rate to 115200.
3. Required libraries: Adafruit_INA219, ESP32 BLE Arduino.
4. Compile and flash to the Smart Charge Box.
